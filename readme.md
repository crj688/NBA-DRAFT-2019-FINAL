The purpose of this file is because it is required for our final grade, lol.
Also the purpose of this file is so that you have instructions as to how to 
go about testing out our final project. Please open the NBA Final Folder.
There you will see a NBA_Final.Rmd file. Please run all the code in that file.
Also you will see a KNN_NBA_Final.Rmd file. 
Please open that and run all the code in that file as well.
Hopefully these instructions were good enough and this is what you are looking for.
Thanks again for such a great class!!!!
